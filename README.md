## A simple implementation of PyCryptodome for RSA encryption in a CLI interface.

PyRSA is a basic RSA client for handling text messages and files. This utility's feature set includes a 2048-bit RSA encryption key-pair generator and a encryption/decryption tool.

PyRSA comes equipped with state-of-the-art encryption technology from PyCryptodome, a self-contained cryptographic library.
